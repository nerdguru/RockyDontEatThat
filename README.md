#Readme for Rocky Don't Eat That

## Home Screen Epic (Versions 0.1.x) started 7/17/12
This first Epic does the following:

* Establishes new project, linked to GitHub, and TestFlight that runs on all 3 of our personal devices (Done, v0.1.2)
* Inserts artwork for app icons and splash screens (Slated, v0.1.3)
* Creates the Home screen layer with artwork for all devices, audio, main text labels using the Janda Manatee font, and a high score board loaded from a plist using the Color Basic font, all using a Singleton to track the device coordinate system (Slated v0.1.4)
